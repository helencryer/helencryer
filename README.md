👋 Hi, I’m Helen

👩🏻‍💻 I’m a junior software engineer based in the North-East of England.

🌱 I’m currently enrolled on Codecademy's Full Stack Enginner Career Path. I am also completing Angela Yu's Web Development course and learning JavaScript through Scrimba.

🏵️ I've completed Code First Girls Web Development and Javascript courses.

✨ In my spare time, I like to supplement my learning by creating my own websites or developing my own projects.
